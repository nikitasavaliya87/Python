# Python Intermediate Level Projects

1. [**Flash Card Project**](https://github.com/nikitasavaliya87/Python/tree/1f865a1b0c13b806666de99f7038b7810eeb9e63/Flash%20Card)
   - Create a flash card app to help users memorize information. The app displays questions (or terms) on a flashcard, and the user needs to answer or recall the information. You can implement this using a graphical interface like Tkinter, or as a command-line project.
   
2. **Automated Email Project**
   - Build a script that sends emails automatically, whether it’s a newsletter, reminders, or notification system. You can use Python’s `smtplib` for sending emails, and integrate scheduling features or data fetching.

3. **ISS (International Space Station) Overhead Notifier**
   - A script that fetches the current location of the ISS and notifies the user when it’s directly overhead in their location. Use the ISS API to get the location and Python libraries like `time`, `requests`, and `smtplib` for sending alerts.

4. **Quiz Application using API**
   - Build a quiz application that fetches random questions from an API (like Open Trivia Database). Users can answer questions, and the application tracks the correct answers. You can create a command-line version or an app with a GUI.

5. **Rain Alert Application**
   - This project notifies users if it's going to rain in their location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to check the weather forecast and Twilio's API to send an SMS or WhatsApp message.

6. [**Stock News Application**](https://github.com/nikitasavaliya87/Python/tree/0d7a17ff069c70b0af06fc6b9fe04a7ea25fec21/Stock%20News%20Application)
   - This Python project monitors stock price changes for a specific company  using the Alpha Vantage API. When a significant price change occurs, it fetches relevant news articles from the NewsAPI and presents them with brief summaries.

7. [**Habit Tracking Application**](https://github.com/nikitasavaliya87/Python/tree/92bae381748b21c98e5c0329406dfd7d74173b74/Habit%20tracker%20Application)
   - This python project uses the Pixela API to create and update a graph that tracks yoga sessions by logging the duration of each session in minutes.

8. [**Habit Tracking Application Using Google Sheet**](https://github.com/nikitasavaliya87/Python/tree/3404a2b2b047279c739ece39f49e86b0fbce037c/Habit%20Tracker%20Using%20GoogleSheet)
   - This Python Exercise Tracker logs exercises with the Nutritionix API, stores data in Google Sheets via Sheety, and manages sensitive info with environment variables. It supports multiple authentication methods.
