# Flash-Card-App

A simple application to help with memorization using digital flashcards. Ideal for learning new words, sentences, or any study material that benefits from repetition.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Study Material**: 
   - Prepare a file (such as a CSV) containing the content you want to memorize.
   - Place the file in the designated directory within the app.

2. **Customize the App**: 
   - Set the app to recognize the columns of your file (e.g., the word and its definition or translation).

3. **Track Your Progress**: 
   - The app will allow you to mark items as "known," and those items will no longer appear in future sessions, ensuring efficient study sessions.

## Where to Use

- Language learning (vocabulary, sentences)
- Exam preparation (formulas, key concepts)
- Any content requiring memorization


The app will save your progress, helping you focus on what you still need to learn.

## Enjoy Learning!!
